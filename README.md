This is a project my team and I worked on, the objective was to create an interactive website to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket all running on EC2 server and having its performance monitered via AWS cloudwatch.
My part was to create the whole front end UI for the website and writing and configuring the backend with Flask and Python to ensure that it's compatible with our EC2 instance and S3 bucket
